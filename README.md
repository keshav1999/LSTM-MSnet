# LSTM-MSNET


In this paper, the author proposes Long Short-Term Memory Multi-Seasonal Net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition based, unified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns.
The paper deals with Time Series Forecasting and proposes a method which takes inspiration from both the Statistical and Deep Learning World.  The Author of the paper evaluates their method on three Public Time Series Datasets and displayed quite promising results on all three.
